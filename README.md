# Java Fundamentals Review & OOP
For this project, my main objectives are to learn how to create classes in Java with specific data and methods, create subclasses using inheritance, override methods from the superclass, use constructors in the subclasses, incorporate both the superclass and subclasses in a test program, and utilize polymorphism to create an array of objects that can hold instances of both the superclass and subclasses.
